What this recipe is: Roti and curry

Roti is a type of flatbread which is used with flour traditionally made from India(atta) mixed with water to make the dough. It is mostly cooked on a low flame until it starts to puff up(some people make it a bit differently). Otherwise it is a thin flatbread with no filling inside it.


Curry is a little "dip" on the side which adds flavor to the roti, there are many different varities of curries which can bring the deliciousness into the roti as we start to beg for more :). It includes certain ingredients which depends on the type of curry you are making.
