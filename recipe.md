How to make it:


1. Place potatoes into a large pot or dutch oven and cover with well-salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover and let the potatoes cook until fork tender–about 12 minutes. Once cooked, drain the potatoes and set them aside.


2. Return the pot to the stove and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add onion and garlic and sauté over medium heat until onion is tender and starts to turn translucent, about 3-5 minutes.


3. Add cumin, cayenne, curry powder, salt, pepper and ginger. Stir to combine before adding tomatoes, chickpeas, and peas.


4. Increase heat to medium-high and stir in the coconut milk. Bring to a simmer before adding the potatoes back to the pot. Reduce heat to low and cook everything together for 3-5 minutes before serving.


5. Enjoy!
